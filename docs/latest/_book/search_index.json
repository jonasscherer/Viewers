Nobody wants to spend time guessing how to reproduce your issue! Before filing, please reproduce your issue more than once and clearly describe the steps taken.\nIf you are reporting a user interface issue, provide screenshots: A picture is worth a thousand words. If your issue concerns the UI, screenshots will help us identify the issue dramatically faster since it can be extremely challenging to describe UI bugs with text. You should still clearly describe the steps that you took to produce the issue.\nInclude platform & environment: Your operating system, web browser, and web browser version are highly relevant for many bugs. Please provide these with all bug reports.\nInclude expected and actual result: Tell us what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. If you don't do this, we might not consider it a bug.\n\nHow can I request a new feature?\nAt the moment we are in the process of defining our roadmap and will do our best to communicate this to the community. If your requested feature is on the roadmap, then it will most likely be built at some point. If it is not, you are welcome to build it yourself and contribute it. If you have resources and would like to fund the development of a feature, please contact us.\nWho should I contact about Academic Collaborations?\nGordon J. Harris at Massachusetts General Hospital is the primary contact for any academic collaborators. We are always happy to hear about new groups interested in using the OHIF framework, and may be able to provide development support if the proposed collaboration has an impact on cancer research.\nDo you offer commercial support?\nThe Open Health Imaging Foundation does not offer commercial support, however, some community members do offer consulting services. The following contacts may be useful:\n\nRob Lewis (Radical Imaging)\n\nPlease file a Pull Request if you wish to add your name or organization to this list.\nI emailed my question to you directly and you did not respond. Why not?\nEmailing developers directly is not a shortcut to faster support. Please file your issues and questions on Github so that everyone can benefit from the discussion and solutions.\nDo your Viewers have 510(k) Clearance from the U.S. F.D.A or CE Marking from the European Commission?\nNO. The OHIF Viewer, Lesion Tracker, and Standalone Viewer, NOT F.D.A. cleared or CE Marked. It is the users responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. The License for the OHIF Framework does not prevent your company or group from seeking F.D.A. clearance for a product built using the framework.\nIf you have gone this route (or are going there), please let us know because we would be interested to hear about your experience.\nAre your Viewers HIPAA Compliant?\nNO. The OHIF Viewer, Lesion Tracker, and Standalone Viewer DO NOT fulfill all of the criteria to become HIPAA Compliant. It is the users responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations.\n"},"contributing.html":{"url":"contributing.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nI would like to contribute code - how do I do this?\nFork the repository, make your change and submit a pull request.\nAny guidance on submitting changes?\nWhile we do appreciate code contributions, triaging and integrating contributed code changes can be very time consuming. Please consider the following tips when working on your pull requests:\n\nFunctionality is appropriate for the repository. Consider posting on the forum if you are not sure.\nCode quality is acceptable. We don't have coding standards defined, but make sure it passes ESLint and looks like the rest of the code in the repository.\nQuality of design is acceptable. This is a bit subjective so you should consider posting on the forum for specific guidance.\nThe scope of the pull request is not too large. Please consider separate pull requests for each feature as big pull requests are very time consuming to understand.\n\nWe will provide feedback on your pull requests as soon as possible. Following the tips above will help ensure your changes are reviewed.\nTesting contribution pull requests\nOHIF uses netlify so that pull requests are autogenerated and available for testing.\nFor example, this url allows you to test pull request 237, the request that created this FAQ entry, using data pulled from Amazon S3.\nReplacing the number 237 in the link below with your pull request number should let you test it as well and you can use this link for discussions on github without requiring reviewers to download and build your branch.\nhttps://deploy-preview-237--ohif.netlify.com/viewer/?url=https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ohif-viewer/sampleDICOM.json\nIf you have made a documentation change, a link like this will let you preview the gitbook generated by the pull request:\nhttps://deploy-preview-237--ohif.netlify.com/contributing.html\n"}}}
